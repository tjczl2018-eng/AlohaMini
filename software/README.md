# Software (LeRobot Integration)


AlohaMini’s LeRobot integration is maintained in a separate repository:


- **lerobot_alohamini:** https://github.com/liyiteng/lerobot_alohamini


This repository is the **single source of truth** for AlohaMini software support (installation, configuration, teleop, dataset recording, etc.).


## Recommended workflow


Please follow the instructions in `lerobot_alohamini`:


1. Clone and install `lerobot_alohamini`
2. Configure your robot / ports as described there
3. Run teleoperation / data collection / evaluation from that repo
