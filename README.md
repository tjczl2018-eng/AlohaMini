# AlohaMini

AlohaMini is a dual-arm mobile robot with a motorized vertical lift — beautifully designed, fully 3D-printable, and affordable.  

Built for embodied AI research and real-world manipulation. Assemble at home in ~60 minutes, customize every part, and train or deploy with LeRobot.

### What Makes It Different

- **Motorized vertical lift** — 0–60 cm travel (floor-to-table reach)
- **Purpose-engineered structure** — optimized for real-world tasks
- **Completely open-source** — hardware and software freely available
- **LeRobot-compatible** — works out of the box
- **Clean, modern design** — built for both function and aesthetics
- **Low-cost & accessible** — engineered so anyone can build a capable robot at home

## Quick Start

Start building and running AlohaMini:

1. **Hardware acquisition** — Purchase components and 3D print parts  
   See **[BOM & 3D-Print](docs/BOM.md)**

1. **Assembly** — build the robot in ~60 minutes (SO-ARM pre-assembled)  
   See **[assembly guide](docs/hardware_assembly.md)**

1. **Software setup & teleoperation** — install, connect, and control the robot  
   See **[software guide](docs/software_setup.md)**





##  Product Line
| Model | Build | Rigidity | Target Users |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AlohaMini** | Fully 3D-printed | Standard | Education, makers, research labs, home builds |
| **AlohaMini Pro** | Hybrid **3D-print + metal** | **3×–5× stiffer** | Algorithm-focused researchers who need plug-and-play, reliable, and stable hardware — without assembly effort |

> Same URDF & control stack across both versions — only structural materials differ.
